## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly** until it has been addressed.
2. Email the vulnerability details to [security@example.com](mailto:security@example.com).
3. Include as much information as possible about the vulnerability, including:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fixes (if any)

You will receive a response within 48 hours acknowledging receipt of your report. We will keep you informed throughout the process until the issue is resolved.

Once a vulnerability is confirmed, we will:
1. Work on a fix and release it as soon as possible
2. Credit you (unless you request to remain anonymous) when we publish the fix

Thank you for helping keep our project secure.
